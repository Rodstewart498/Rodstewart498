# Hey, I'm Rod 👋

**Business automation developer** building production systems that manage **11,000+ SKUs** across eBay, Shopify, and custom platforms.

I come from running an ecommerce operation and got tired of manual processes — so I automated them. What started as scripts turned into a **40,000+ line automation platform** with 137 API routes, computer vision search, strategic pricing engines, and cross-platform inventory sync.

---

### 🔧 What I Build

- **Multi-platform ecommerce automation** — eBay Trading API, Shopify REST API, Firebase real-time sync
- **Visual product search** — FAISS vector indexing + OpenCV for sub-second similarity matching across inventory
- **Strategic pricing engines** — Automated discount management, margin health analysis, psychological pricing
- **Batch operations at scale** — Listing pipelines with snapshot capture, photo recovery, and background job processing with pause/resume/stop controls
